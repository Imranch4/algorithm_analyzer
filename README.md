# algorithm_analyzer
This C++ project offers utilities to measure the execution time and theoretical complexity of sorting and searching algorithms. By passing any algorithm function to the measurement tools, you can quickly obtain its runtime in seconds and compare its performance across different input sizes. Ideal for studying and analyzing algorithm efficiency.
